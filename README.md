# immersive-zen-space

Im building an app that feels like a real life, interactive experience. its the opposite of modern social media content, theres not mindless scrolling, no hooks. instead, when you enter the app, it feels like your being welcomed into a relaxing  space, like to meditate. you feel like someone is talking to you, welcoming you, inviting you to join them. then they are interacted with in a way that gets them ready to sit down and have an experience. Having an experience similar to going to the theatre, or a type of immersive show. its something that asks you to be present, to pay attention, similar to a medidation app. once they are in the headspace to listen, they are presented with the experience, which is a mix of videos, and other mobile interactive functions. this part cannot be paused, and it dissapears once its finished - which adds to the feeling of scarcity which can make the user present. 

once the experience is finished, you are presented with way to engage with the content of the experience more - such as a Q&A with the journalism and storyteller, or more factual information about the subject, or an invitation to join a community of other people to talk about the issue. 

this app will have one experience drop every month.
